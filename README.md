### Hey there!

I'm Tiago Crizanto, always working on some tech stuff...
My main stacks are on Microsoft technologies like C#, ASP NET Core / Full, Azure, SQL Server, Xamarin Forms and others.
I've been working with several technologies for more than 10 years building software for several companies in the private sector, applying technical knowledge and experience handling agile teams.
